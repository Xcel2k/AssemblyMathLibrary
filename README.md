# AssemblyMathLibrary
Made a Math Library in Assembly Language using the Netwide Assembler (NASM). Fully funcitonal when integrated with data. 

This was a casual project which spanned over the course of 2 weeks. I was able to fully learn the SSE3 and SSE4 instruction sets with the help of this project. 

What motivated me towards this project was my worthy Instructor from NUST Baluchistan Campus (NBC) Mr. Najeeb Ullah who had been teaching us assembly language 
in the third semester. 

This was made possible through his constant efforts and guidance. Thank you Sir.
